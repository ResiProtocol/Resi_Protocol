## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document provides a comprehensive specification of the tokenomics and utility models for the RESI Protocol. It details the economic design, token distribution, utility functions, incentive mechanisms, and stability controls that underpin the protocol's dual-token system. This specification serves as the authoritative reference for all token-related aspects of the RESI Protocol ecosystem.

### 1.2 Scope

This specification covers:

- Fundamental token characteristics
- Token utility and functionality
- Distribution and allocation models
- Stability mechanisms for UVU
- Economics of the RESI governance token
- Fee structures and revenue models
- Staking and rewards systems
- Economic security considerations
- Protocol incentive alignment
- Treasury management for long-term sustainability
- Market dynamics and risk management
- Implementation timeline and milestones

### 1.3 Token System Overview

The RESI Protocol implements a dual-token model consisting of:

1. **RESI (Resilient, Stable Infrastructure) Token**: A stablecoin designed to maintain stable purchasing power by being pegged to a diversified basket of global assets, serving as a neutral global currency.

2. **REGI (Resilient, Governance Infrastructure) Token**: The protocol's governance and utility token that powers the ecosystem, enabling protocol governance, incentivizing participation, and capturing value from network activity.

This dual-token approach separates the stability function (RESI) from the governance and growth function (REGI), creating complementary tokens with distinct purposes while maintaining interconnected economic mechanisms.

### 1.4 Design Principles

The tokenomics design of the RESI Protocol is guided by the following core principles:

#### 1.4.1 Economic Sustainability

- Self-sustaining economic model
- Value capture proportional to network utility
- Long-term viability without reliance on inflation
- Balanced incentives across all stakeholders

#### 1.4.2 Aligned Incentives

- Stakeholder rewards aligned with protocol success
- Prevention of value extraction attacks
- Long-term alignment through time-incentives
- Balanced token distribution to prevent centralization

#### 1.4.3 Stability & Security

- Robust stability mechanisms for UVU
- Over-collateralization for economic security
- Multi-layered defense against economic attacks
- Risk-adjusted parameters for sustainable growth

#### 1.4.4 Utility Maximization

- Clear and valuable token utility
- Continuous expansion of utility functions
- Real economic value backing token demand
- Network effects reinforcing token value

#### 1.4.5 Adaptability

- Parameter adjustment through governance
- Flexible economic controls
- Data-driven optimization
- Evolution capabilities as the protocol matures
