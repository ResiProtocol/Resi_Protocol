# Requirements Document

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

This document defines the requirements for building the RESI Protocol - an algorithmic stablecoin with integrated governance that leverages advanced zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to enhance privacy, security, and trust. The project addresses key challenges including depegging risks, oracle manipulation, and centralized governance, while adding an extra layer of confidentiality through ZKP-enabled features.

### 1.2 Scope

The system will include:

- A stablecoin mechanism with minting and burning capabilities enhanced by confidential ZKP validations.
- A hybrid collateral system with diversified assets and ZKP-based collateral proofs.
- An Automated Stability Reserve that deploys capital during market volatility.
- A multi-oracle aggregation mechanism using ZKPs for private, verifiable data feeds.
- An adaptive governance framework with confidential voting and proposal processes via ZKPs.
- A user-friendly dApp interface for interacting with both the core protocol and ZKP components.

### 1.3 Definitions & Acronyms

- **MVP**: Minimum Viable Product.
- **DAO**: Decentralized Autonomous Organization.
- **dApp**: Decentralized Application.
- **ZKP**: Zero-Knowledge Proof.
- **PLONK**: A universal zk-SNARK protocol that uses a universal trusted setup.

- **ERC-20**: A standard for fungible tokens on Ethereum.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Stablecoin & Collateral System

#### Mint/Burn Mechanism:

- **Standard Logic**:
  - Implement smart contract functions to mint stablecoins when collateral is deposited and burn stablecoins during redemption, maintaining the peg based on real-time market conditions.
- **ZKP Integration**:
  - _Confidential Minting_:
    - Users generate a ZKP that confirms they have deposited sufficient collateral and meet the collateralization requirementsâ€”without revealing the exact amount.
  - _Burn Validations_:
    - Proofs that tokens are burned only according to the protocol's rules (peg maintenance, collateral ratios) are generated and verified on-chain.

#### Hybrid Collateral System:

- **Multi-Asset Support**:
  - Accept various assets (e.g., BTC, ETH, stablecoins, decentralized LP tokens) as collateral.
- **ZKP-Based Collateral Proofs**:
  - _Collateral Sufficiency Proofs_:
    - Vaults or liquidity pools generate ZKPs to prove they are collateralized without exposing the exact values.
  - _Collateral Ownership Privacy_:
    - Users can prove contribution to a pool while keeping their wallet details and exact amounts confidential.

#### Automated Stability Reserve:

- **Reserve Activation**:
  - On-chain treasury that deploys capital based on predefined thresholds.
- **ZKP Audits**:
  - Periodically generate proofs that reserves meet or exceed required thresholds without revealing specific wallet balances or reserve compositions.

### 2.2 Oracle Aggregation System

#### Multi-Oracle Integration:

- Integrate multiple data feeds (e.g., Chainlink, Band, API3) to aggregate asset price data.

#### ZKP-Enhanced Price Feeds:

- **Private Data Submission**:
  - Oracle operators submit confidential data along with a ZKP that the reported price lies within an acceptable range.
- **Aggregation Proofs**:
  - When aggregating data (e.g., via median or weighted average), generate a ZKP that confirms the final reported price is correct without revealing individual data points.
- **Selective Disclosure**:
  - For cases involving regulatory or KYC data, ZKPs can verify compliance without disclosing personal details.

### 2.3 Governance System

#### Governance Token:

- **Standard Functionality**:
  - Implement an ERC-20 based token that grants voting rights and incentivizes participation.

#### DAO Governance Process:

- **Proposal Creation**:
  - Use ZKPs to verify that only eligible, whitelisted participants can submit proposals without exposing their identity or wallet addresses.

#### Private Voting:

- **Confidential Vote Casting**:
  - Voters generate proofs that they hold the required tokens and that each vote is unique, while keeping individual voting details and token balances hidden.
- **One-Person-One-Vote**:
  - In scenarios where voting is identity-based, ZKPs prove uniqueness without exposing real-world identities.
- **Vote Tally**:
  - Conduct confidential tallying where only the final outcome is revealed, ensuring individual votes remain private.
- **Sybil Resistance**:
  - Implement ZKPs to verify that each vote is unique and not duplicated, reinforcing the integrity of the voting process.

### 2.4 User Interface & Interactions

#### dApp Interface:

- A web-based interface for users to:
  - Deposit collateral, mint/redeem stablecoins, and interact with governance proposals.
  - Generate or verify ZK proofs as part of secure, private transactions.

#### Wallet Integration:

- Ensure secure connection to user wallets (e.g., MetaMask) that can handle ZKP-related transactions.

#### Real-Time Feedback:

- Provide instant feedback and visualizations (e.g., status of ZK proofs, governance vote outcomes) without exposing sensitive details.

### 2.5 Testing & Simulation Requirements

- **Simulation of Extreme Scenarios**:
  - Test minting, burning, and collateral deposit operations under simulated market stress.
- **Oracle Manipulation Testing**:
  - Introduce manipulated data scenarios to verify that ZKPs correctly validate and filter out anomalies.
- **Governance Process Testing**:
  - Run controlled simulations of proposal creation, confidential voting, and vote tallying to validate ZKP integrations.
- **End-to-End ZKP Validation**:
  - Ensure that proofs for collateral, reserves, and transaction validations are correctly generated, submitted, and verified on-chain.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Security

- **Smart Contract Security**:
  - Follow best practices (e.g., using OpenZeppelin libraries) to avoid vulnerabilities like reentrancy, overflow/underflow, and flash loan exploits.
- **ZKP Security**:
  - Use PLONK-based zk-SNARKs for efficiency and minimized trusted setup requirements.
  - Ensure the ZKP circuits are thoroughly audited and tested for correctness and performance.
- **Oracle & Governance Security**:
  - Implement rigorous validation and anomaly detection mechanisms alongside ZKP proofs to maintain system integrity.

### 3.2 Performance & Scalability

- **Efficient ZKP Verification**:
  - Optimize circuits and verification processes to minimize on-chain computation and gas costs.
- **Scalable Architecture**:
  - Ensure that the system can handle increasing numbers of users, transactions, and ZKP validations without performance degradation.

### 3.3 Reliability & Availability

- **High Uptime**:
  - Design the system for maximum uptime for both smart contracts and the dApp interface.
- **Fault Tolerance**:
  - Implement backup and recovery procedures, particularly for ZKP generation and validation processes.

### 3.4 Usability & Accessibility

- **Intuitive dApp**:
  - Ensure the user interface is clear and easy to use, providing guidance on ZKP-related actions.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**:
  - Provide thorough guides on how ZKP features work within the system for both end-users and developers.

### 3.5 Maintainability & Extensibility

- **Modular Code Design**:
  - Separate core logic from ZKP verification modules to allow independent updates and improvements.
- **Version Control & Change Management**:
  - Maintain a clear change log and update process for both smart contracts and ZKP circuits.

### 3.6 Regulatory & Compliance

- **Data Privacy**:
  - Use ZKPs to comply with privacy regulations by ensuring sensitive user data is never exposed on-chain.
- **Transparent Auditing**:
  - Provide verifiable ZKP audits of reserves, collateral, and governance processes to maintain stakeholder trust.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

- **Stability & Peg Maintenance**:
  - The stablecoin must maintain its peg under simulated market conditions, with ZKP proofs verifying proper collateralization and mint/burn operations.
- **Oracle Resilience**:
  - The oracle system must effectively validate data using ZKPs, with manipulated feeds correctly identified and excluded.
- **Confidential Governance**:
  - Voting and proposal processes must demonstrate that ZKPs successfully hide individual voter details while confirming eligibility and uniqueness.
- **User Experience**:
  - The dApp interface should facilitate seamless interactions with ZKP components, providing clear feedback without compromising privacy.
- **Security Audits**:
  - No critical vulnerabilities should be found during internal and third-party audits, including tests on the ZKP circuits and integrations.

## 5. Additional Notes

- **Interdependencies**:
  - Clearly define the dependencies between ZKP modules and core smart contract functions.
