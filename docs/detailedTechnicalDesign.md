## 2. System Components

### 2.1 Stablecoin Contract

#### 2.1.1 Data Structures

**State Variables:**

- `uint256 totalSupply;` – Total stablecoins in circulation.
- `mapping(address => uint256) balances;` – User balances.
- `uint256 pegTarget;` – Target price (e.g., $1).
- `uint256 collateralRatio;` – Dynamic collateral ratio.

**Events:**

- `Mint(address indexed user, uint256 amount);`
- `Burn(address indexed user, uint256 amount);`
- `ZKPVerified(bytes proofData);` – Emitted upon successful ZKP verification.

#### 2.1.2 Functions and Interfaces

**Mint/Burn Functions:**

- `function mint(uint256 collateralAmount, bytes calldata zkProof) external returns (uint256 tokensMinted);`
  - Verifies ZKP that collateral meets collateralization rules without revealing the exact amount.
  - Uses oracle price data to compute if conditions are met.
- `function burn(uint256 tokenAmount, bytes calldata zkProof) external returns (uint256 collateralReturned);`
  - Confirms via ZKP that the burn operation complies with algorithmic rules.

**Peg Maintenance:**

- `function adjustPeg(bytes calldata zkProof) external;`
  - Invoked by automated triggers using ZKP validations ensuring operations follow protocol rules.

**Interfaces:**

- Calls to the collateral pool for deposit/withdrawal.
- Integration with the oracle aggregator for current market prices.

### 2.2 Collateral Pool and Automated Stability Reserve

#### 2.2.1 Data Structures

**Collateral Registry:**

- `mapping(address => uint256) public collateralBalances;`

**Reserve Variables:**

**Events:**

- `CollateralDeposited(address indexed user, address token, uint256 amount);`
- `ReserveDeployed(uint256 amount);`
- `CollateralZKPVerified(bytes proofData);`

#### 2.2.2 Core Logic

**Collateral Management:**

- Functions to deposit, withdraw, and value collateral, each integrated with ZKP-based proofs:
  - Collateral Sufficiency Proofs: ZKP circuits validate that a vault or pool remains collateralized without revealing exact balances.

**Reserve Activation:**

- Triggers based on market volatility, with ZKP proofs verifying that deployment is according to protocol thresholds.

**Rebalancing:**

- Logic for periodic rebalancing using confidential proofs that aggregate collateral data.

### 2.3 Oracle Aggregation Module

#### 2.3.1 Integration with Multiple Oracles

**Supported Oracles:**

- Chainlink, Band, API3.

**Data Collection:**

- Each oracle submits data along with a ZKP proving that the reported price is within a valid range.

**Data Validation & Aggregation:**

- **Aggregation Logic:**
  - Uses statistical methods (e.g., median or weighted average) and generates a ZKP that confirms the final aggregated price is correct.
- **Cross-Validation:**
  - ZKP-based anomaly detection filters out manipulated feeds.

**Interfaces:**

- `function getValidatedPrice() external view returns (uint256 price, bytes memory zkProof);`

### 2.4 Governance and DAO Module

#### 2.4.1 Governance Token

**Implementation:**

- An ERC-20 token with additional governance functions.

**Voting Power:**

- State variables track voting power and incorporate ZKP-enhanced adjustments.

**ZKP-Enhanced Token Functions:**

- Prove eligibility and validate token holdings for confidential voting without revealing the balance.

#### 2.4.2 DAO Contract & Voting Mechanisms

**Proposal Lifecycle:**

- **Proposal Creation:**
  - Function `proposeChange(bytes calldata proposalData, bytes calldata zkProof)` ensures only eligible users can submit proposals through ZKP verification.
- **Voting:**
  - Voters cast votes with attached ZK proofs confirming they hold the required tokens and that each vote is unique.
- **Confidential Tally:**
  - A function tallies votes using ZKPs that hide individual vote details while proving overall correctness.

**Governance Dashboard:**

- Real-time interface showing proposal statuses and vote outcomes without exposing sensitive details.

#### 2.4.3 Tokenized Governance Incentives

**Incentives:**

- Active participation rewards verified by ZK proofs.
- Penalties for malicious behavior, verified through confidential reputation scores.

### 2.5 User Interface (dApp)

#### 2.5.1 Front-End Technologies

**Framework:**

## 3. Integration Details

### 3.1 Inter-Contract Communication

- **Stablecoin ↔ Collateral Pool:**
  - Direct calls to deposit/withdraw collateral, with ZKP proofs ensuring confidential validations.
- **Stablecoin ↔ Oracle Aggregator:**
  - Fetch current price data and ZKP-validated proofs to trigger minting or burning.
- **Governance ↔ Other Modules:**
  - Approved proposals trigger parameter updates across stablecoin and collateral contracts via DAO, with ZKP proofs ensuring authenticity.

### 3.2 Data Flow Examples

- **Minting Process:**
  1. User deposits collateral via the dApp.
  2. Collateral pool verifies deposit and generates a ZKP for collateralization.
  3. Stablecoin contract retrieves the current price and validates the minting process with a ZKP.
  4. Stablecoins are minted, and the transaction is recorded along with proof logs.
- **Governance Process:**
  1. A proposal is submitted with an attached ZKP proving eligibility.
  2. Votes are cast with individual ZK proofs that validate the vote's uniqueness and the voter's token holding.
  3. The final tally is computed and verified using a confidential ZKP, ensuring the process is transparent yet private.
