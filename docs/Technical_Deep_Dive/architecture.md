## 2. System Overview

The RESI Protocol architecture is designed as a multi-layered system with specialized components that work together to maintain a stable, private, and secure financial ecosystem. At its core, the protocol creates a stablecoin (RESI) pegged to the Universal Value Unit (UVU), which provides a more resilient reference point than traditional fiat-pegged stablecoins.

The system employs an AI-driven approach to stability, continuously monitoring market conditions and proactively adjusting protocol parameters to maintain peg alignment. Zero-knowledge proofs enable privacy across all critical operations, from transactions and collateral management to governance and oracle data.

This architecture prioritizes:

- **Stability**: Through diversified collateral, AI-driven parameter adjustments, and an Automated Stability Reserve
- **Privacy**: Via zero-knowledge proofs embedded throughout the system
- **Decentralization**: With a hybrid governance model combining quadratic and conviction voting
- **Security**: Through multiple layers of protection, including circuit breakers, multi-oracle data, and quantum resistance
- **Scalability**: With a modular design facilitating upgrades and cross-chain deployment
- **Usability**: Through account abstraction providing seamless user experience
- **Compliance**: With privacy-preserving regulatory features
- **Sustainability**: Through energy-aware consensus and carbon tracking mechanisms
- **Identity**: Self-sovereign identity principles applied throughout the protocol

### 2.1 Modular Architecture Patterns

The RESI Protocol adopts a highly modular architecture that clearly separates concerns and responsibilities:

- **Execution Layer**: Handles transaction processing and state transitions
- **Settlement Layer**: Manages finalization and confirmation of transactions
- **Consensus Layer**: Ensures agreement on the state of the protocol through hybrid consensus mechanisms
- **Data Availability Layer**: Guarantees that all necessary data is accessible
- **Identity Layer**: Provides self-sovereign identity services across the stack

This modular approach provides several architectural advantages:

- **Component Independence**: Each module can be developed, tested, and upgraded independently
- **Plug-and-Play Flexibility**: Components can be swapped with alternative implementations
- **Standardized Interfaces**: Well-defined APIs between modules ensure interoperability
- **Specialized Optimization**: Each module can be optimized for its specific function
- **Isolated Security Domains**: Vulnerabilities in one module have limited impact on others
- **Crypto-Agility**: Cryptographic primitives can be upgraded without affecting other components
- **Energy Optimization**: Resource usage can be fine-tuned at the component level

The service-oriented architecture principles have been adapted to the blockchain context, enabling a more resilient and adaptable system that can evolve over time without disrupting core functionality.
