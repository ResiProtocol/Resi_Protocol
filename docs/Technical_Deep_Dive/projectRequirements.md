## 2. Project Overview

### 2.1 Project Background

The global financial system faces significant challenges including inconsistent monetary policies, geopolitical tensions affecting currency stability, and lack of universal access to stable financial instruments. The RESI Protocol aims to address these challenges by creating a decentralized, blockchain-based system for a universal value unit that provides stability, accessibility, and neutrality.

### 2.2 Project Objectives

1. Create a decentralized financial protocol that issues a Universal Value Unit (UVU) as a stable global currency
2. Develop a robust collateral management system supporting diverse asset types
3. Implement a secure and transparent oracle aggregation system for reliable price feeds
4. Create a hybrid governance system that balances decentralization with operational efficiency
5. Establish cross-chain infrastructure to ensure universal accessibility
6. Design comprehensive security measures to protect user assets and protocol integrity
7. Build intuitive user interfaces for various stakeholder interactions
8. Create an ecosystem that incentivizes adoption and usage

### 2.3 Vision Statement

To create a neutral, globally accessible financial protocol that provides monetary stability and serves as a foundation for a more inclusive and efficient global financial system.

### 2.4 Mission Statement

To develop and deploy a decentralized protocol that issues the Universal Value Unit (UVU) as a stable, accessible, and neutral global currency backed by a diversified portfolio of assets and governed through transparent, community-driven mechanisms.

### 2.5 Success Criteria

1. Successful deployment of all core protocol components across at least 5 blockchain networks
2. UVU price stability maintained within Â±2% of target over 30-day periods
3. Minimum of $500 million Total Value Locked (TVL) within 12 months of mainnet launch
4. At least 100,000 unique users interacting with the protocol within 12 months
5. No critical security incidents for at least 6 months post-launch
6. Establishment of at least 10 strategic partnerships with other DeFi protocols
7. Positive third-party security audits with all critical issues resolved
8. Successful transition to full decentralized governance within 24 months
