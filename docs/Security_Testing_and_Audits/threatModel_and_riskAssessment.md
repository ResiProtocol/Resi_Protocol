## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Threat Modeling Approach

This assessment uses a hybrid approach combining multiple threat modeling methodologies:

#### 2.1.1 STRIDE Framework

STRIDE is used to categorize threats into the following types:

- **S**poofing: Impersonating something or someone
- **T**ampering: Modifying data or code
- **R**epudiation: Claiming not to have performed an action
- **I**nformation Disclosure: Exposing sensitive information
- **D**enial of Service: Preventing legitimate access
- **E**levation of Privilege: Gaining unauthorized access

#### 2.1.2 Attack Trees

Attack trees are used to map out potential paths an attacker might take to compromise the system, with the root representing the attacker's goal and branches representing different attack methods.

#### 2.1.3 Data Flow Analysis

Data flow diagrams (DFDs) are used to illustrate how data moves through the system, identifying trust boundaries and potential weak points.

### 2.2 Risk Assessment Methodology

#### 2.2.1 Risk Calculation Formula

Risk is calculated as:

```
Risk = Impact Ã— Likelihood
```

#### 2.2.2 Impact Scoring

| Score | Level      | Definition                                                      |
| ----- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 5     | Critical   | Catastrophic impact on protocol stability, funds, or reputation |
| 4     | High       | Significant impact on protocol operations or user funds         |
| 3     | Medium     | Moderate impact on protocol functionality or user experience    |
| 2     | Low        | Minor impact with limited consequences                          |
| 1     | Negligible | Minimal impact with no significant consequences                 |

#### 2.2.3 Likelihood Scoring

| Score | Level          | Definition                                         |

| 5     | Almost Certain | Expected to occur in most circumstances (>90%)     |
| 4     | Likely         | Will probably occur in most circumstances (60-90%) |
| 3     | Possible       | Might occur at some point (30-60%)                 |
| 2     | Unlikely       | Could occur but not expected (10-30%)              |
| 1     | Rare           | May occur only in exceptional circumstances (<10%) |

| ---------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 20-25      | Critical | Immediate action required; protocol deployment should be delayed until mitigated |
| 15-19      | High     | Prompt action required; implement mitigations before mainnet launch              |
| 8-14       | Medium   | Planned action required; develop mitigation strategies with clear timeline       |
| 4-7        | Low      | Monitor and implement controls as part of normal development                     |
| 1-3        | Very Low | Accept risk with standard controls                                               |

## 8. Detailed Risk Analysis

### 8.1 High Risk Items

#### 8.1.1 SC-01: Reentrancy Attacks

**Description:**  
Malicious contracts may re-enter protocol functions before state updates are completed, potentially allowing multiple withdrawals or other manipulations.

**Attack Scenario:**

1. Attacker creates a malicious contract with a fallback function that re-enters the protocol
2. Attacker initiates a legitimate withdrawal or function call
3. During execution, the protocol sends ETH to the attacker's contract
4. The malicious fallback function executes, re-entering the protocol before state is updated
5. The re-entered function operates on outdated state information
6. Attacker potentially drains funds through multiple withdrawals

**Impact Analysis:**  
Critical (5): Could lead to direct theft of funds from the protocol

**Likelihood Analysis:**  
Possible (3): Well-known attack vector but preventable with proper controls

**Current Controls:**

- Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern in all functions
- ReentrancyGuard implementation for critical functions
- Proper state management sequence

**Recommended Mitigations:**

1. Implement reentrancy guards on all external functions that transfer assets
2. Ensure all state changes occur before external calls
3. Consider using pull payment patterns instead of push where applicable
4. Comprehensive testing with specific reentrancy test cases
5. External security audits focusing on reentrancy

#### 8.1.2 SC-06: Flash Loan Attacks

**Description:**  
Attackers use flash loans to temporarily acquire large amounts of assets to manipulate prices, liquidations, or governance.

**Attack Scenario:**

1. Attacker takes out a flash loan for a large amount of an asset
2. Uses loan to manipulate price oracle readings or market prices
3. Exploits the temporary price deviation to profit from the protocol
4. Repays flash loan with profits remaining

**Impact Analysis:**  
Critical (5): Could lead to significant fund loss or protocol insolvency

**Likelihood Analysis:**  
Possible (3): Common in DeFi but preventable with proper controls

**Current Controls:**

- Time-weighted average prices (TWAP) for critical operations
- Multiple oracle sources with outlier rejection
- Circuit breakers for suspicious price movements

**Recommended Mitigations:**

1. Implement manipulation-resistant price oracles (TWAP with sufficient window)
2. Use multiple independent oracle sources with median or trimmed mean calculations
3. Implement price deviation circuit breakers
4. Add rate limiting for large operations
5. Simulate flash loan attacks during testing

#### 8.1.3 OR-01: Price Manipulation

**Description:**  
Manipulation of price oracle data leading to incorrect asset valuations, which could affect liquidations, collateralization ratios, and protocol solvency.

**Attack Scenario:**

1. Attacker targets illiquid markets or specific price feed
2. Executes trades to artificially move the price significantly
3. Protocol uses manipulated price for critical operations
4. Attacker profits from incorrect pricing (e.g., avoiding liquidation or triggering others)

**Impact Analysis:**  
Critical (5): Could lead to significant loss of funds and protocol instability

**Likelihood Analysis:**  
Possible (3): Common attack vector that requires specific mitigations

**Current Controls:**

- Multi-oracle design with validation logic
- Outlier detection and rejection
- Circuit breakers for extreme price movements

**Recommended Mitigations:**

1. Implement robust oracle aggregation with minimum required consensus
2. Use time-weighted averages for price calculations
3. Implement circuit breakers for suspicious price movements
4. Set price deviation thresholds and fallback mechanisms
5. Regularly audit oracle integration components

### 8.2 Medium Risk Items

#### 8.2.1 CC-08: Inconsistent State

**Description:**  
Cross-chain state desynchronization where the protocol's state varies across different blockchains, potentially leading to incorrect operations or double-spending.

**Attack Scenario:**

1. Message delivery fails between chains but sender assumes completion
2. Protocol continues operation with different state across chains
3. Users might exploit inconsistencies for double-spending or other attacks

**Impact Analysis:**  
High (4): Could lead to operational issues and potential financial losses

**Likelihood Analysis:**  
Possible (3): Cross-chain messaging failures are relatively common

**Current Controls:**

- Message acknowledgment requirements
- Periodic state reconciliation
- Monitoring for cross-chain discrepancies

**Recommended Mitigations:**

1. Implement state verification and reconciliation mechanisms
2. Design protocols to be eventually consistent
3. Add automatic detection and alerts for state inconsistencies
4. Implement recovery procedures for desynchronized states
5. Design cross-chain operations to be idempotent where possible

#### 8.2.2 GOV-03: Time-Sensitive Voting Attacks

**Description:**  
Exploitation of governance timing to pass proposals during periods of low participation or when certain stakeholders are unlikely to participate.

**Attack Scenario:**

1. Attacker identifies periods of historically low participation
2. Submits controversial proposal during this period
3. Rallies supporting votes while regular participants are absent
4. Proposal passes with artificially low quorum

**Impact Analysis:**  
High (4): Could lead to unwanted protocol changes

**Likelihood Analysis:**  
Possible (3): Requires planning but is feasible

**Current Controls:**

- Minimum quorum requirements
- Extended voting periods
- Timelocks for implementation

**Recommended Mitigations:**

1. Implement dynamic quorum requirements based on historical participation
2. Extend voting periods for significant proposals
3. Require announcement period before formal voting begins
4. Implement delegation mechanisms to maintain voting power
5. Develop emergency response for suspicious governance activity

### 8.3 Low Risk Items

#### 8.3.1 SC-08: Gas Limitation Attacks

**Description:**  
Exploiting gas limits to prevent execution of certain functions, particularly in batch operations or complex transactions.

**Attack Scenario:**

1. Attacker identifies function with variable gas costs based on inputs
2. Crafts input that causes gas consumption to exceed block gas limit
3. Function becomes effectively unusable for legitimate users

**Impact Analysis:**  
Medium (3): Temporary denial of service for specific functions

**Likelihood Analysis:**  
Unlikely (2): Requires specific conditions and typically has limited impact

**Current Controls:**

- Gas optimization for critical functions
- Limits on batch operation sizes
- Circuit breakers for gas-intensive operations

**Recommended Mitigations:**

1. Implement gas limits for variable-cost operations
2. Design batch operations with configurable size limits
3. Test gas consumption with edge case inputs
4. Provide alternative execution paths for gas-intensive operations
5. Monitor gas usage patterns for anomalies

#### 8.3.2 GOV-02: Proposal Flooding

**Description:**  
Overwhelming the governance system with numerous proposals to cause voter fatigue or distract from important issues.

**Attack Scenario:**

1. Attacker submits many marginal or nuisance proposals
2. Governance participants become overwhelmed
3. Participation drops due to voter fatigue
4. Important proposals receive less attention

**Impact Analysis:**  
Low (2): Primarily causes inefficiency rather than direct harm

**Likelihood Analysis:**  
Possible (3): Requires minimal resources to execute

**Current Controls:**

- Proposal submission requirements
- Proposal filtering mechanisms
- Governance participation incentives

**Recommended Mitigations:**

1. Implement proposal submission costs or stake requirements
2. Add reputation-based filtering for proposals
3. Develop tiered governance with preliminary review
4. Create tooling to help voters manage proposal volume
5. Implement proposal categorization and prioritization
